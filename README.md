# StardewOfDark
This music pack replaces music from Stardew Valley with music from the legendary indie chiptune composer FearOfDark.

It replaces almost the entire soundtrack with various chiptune music from him, plus with a few tracker music in the mix as well. Expect lots of good bangers, possibly some covers by him.

Comes built in with seasonal town music, so you can enjoy a new tune as you walk through town as the season changes.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Download SMAPI and Content Patcher
Then download the main music pack from the Releases tab (recommended), also if you want, the Bonus Music Pack optionally for extra music in game.
Please note that there are two versions: the normal version, and the Fast Load Version coming soon which is about 50% the size of the normal version. The Fast Load version will greatly improve load times, but at the cost of the BGM quality.
Done :)

There will also be a Bonus Music Pack that you can install with the mod to add new tunes to the experience. These tunes will play when:
Rain happens, with three tunes playing depending on the season (except winter).
Night falls in the valley, with four tunes playing depending on the season
(1.6 spoiler)
Spoiler:  Show
You are in Ginger Island in Fall and Winter (the original tune will still play in the Spring and Summer)
Your second year and up, with THREE BRAND NEW TRACKS that will play instead of the normal tracks at a 50% chance (Coming soon!)

Whatever you are chilling in The Coffee Zone, Dreamscaping an Exit Plan, or Surfing On A Sine Wave while Rolling Down The Street*, this music pack will blow you away. Bring headphones for the best experience.

If you are wondering what song is playing, be sure to check out this spreadsheet here. If you also have the "Now Playing" mod, you can copy and paste this list into the config file (in the "TracksToRename" entry).

* Yes, this pack will contain Rolling Down The Street. You will have to see for yourself :)

(Note: Please note that some songs may or may not fit the situation in-game. I tried my best to fit each song to best fit the situation. Songs that are not changed are "Flower Dance", "A Stillness in the Rain", "Alex's Keepsake", "Emily's Dance", "Mermaid Song", and "The Happy Junimo Show Theme".)
